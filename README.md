    1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
       This project was intended to allow the demonstartion of the following compotencies:
          
          1. Write interface software to control hardware components.
          2. Analyze fundamental considerations regarding hardware architecture design and their impact on application performance.
          3. Recommend and justify emerging systems architectures and technologies based on business requirements.
          
        In this project, we were an employee for "SysTec" who planned to get into the lucrative market of global smart thermostats. I had to turn a microcontroller
       into a thermostat using the temperature sensor. This temperature could be increased or decreased using the microcontroller buttons and an LED light would
       activate to simulate when the "heat" would turn on or off. The last step was a reflection document in which we compared various microcontrollers to
       decide which one was the best fit for this company according to the specifications required. 
    
    2. What did you do particularly well?
    
       I believe that I created a properly working and efficient thermostat from said microcontroller which acheives what the company was looking for. 
    
    3. Where could you improve?
    
          I believe that I could improve when creating technical documents for the task scheduler. My diagram was not the best and I believe
        that I could have performed better when addressing the technical specifications.
    
    4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
       I will definitely utilize microcontrollers in future projects due to the flexibility of their use-cases. 
    
    5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    
        All of the skills that I have learned would transfer over to another embedded systems and technologies course/project. If we are just referring to
       programming in general, researching and analyzing documentation, creating technical documentation, and creating maintainable code will all be 
       useful in future courses or projects.
    
    6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
       I ensured that this project was readable, maintainable, and adaptable by following best practice guidelines and utilizing comments and proper formatting.
